# PI-Desktop renderer excerpts / LGPL-3.0

This distribution uses renderer-only excerpts from **PI-Desktop**, by its upstream authors/contributors, licensed under GNU LGPL version 3. The excerpts and our modifications remain under LGPL-3.0. See `LICENSE` (LGPL-3.0) and `COPYING` (GPL-3.0, incorporated by LGPL).

Source: https://github.com/vastsa/PI-Desktop
Fixed revision: `0d47d26769ecbeca1c3ab56fa83b58a91de8190e` (research checkout, not a claim to match the user's installed Pi version).

Original files are preserved in `upstream/`:
- `apps/desktop/src/components/ContextMenu.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/lib/context-menu.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/lib/scrollbar-reveal.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/styles/base.css` (scrollbar rules, lines 126–161)
- `apps/desktop/src/styles/ui-kit.css` (context menu, lines 256–340)

Local modifications:
- ContextMenu: direct React body portal; remove transcript/TeX selection integrations; explicit sidebar point/trigger; preserve viewport placement, dismissal, focus restoration and keyboard navigation; prevent the trigger's pointerdown from defeating click-to-toggle; avoid refocusing on metadata renders.
- Placement: retain Pi's viewport clamp/rounding, expose only renderer types needed here.
- Scrollbar reveal: logic unchanged, comments/formatting shortened; capture passive scroll and 300ms hold, including timer/attribute cleanup.
- CSS: map Pi theme variables to this project's tokens; reset local button defaults; restore `scrollbar-width/color: auto` to prevent older project rules from overriding the 6px WebKit scrollbar. Quiet transparent track/thumb; hover/focus/scroll reveal.

Project-local `SessionRow` and `sessions.pin` implement dialogue operations using the Praat host, not Pi's Sidebar/store/IPC/Agent runtime. Composer status is project-local code.

## Conversation sidebar extraction

The complete upstream `Sidebar.tsx` and its sidebar dependencies are preserved
unchanged in `upstream/sidebar/`, at the same fixed revision above. That directory
includes `SessionHoverCard.tsx`, `useSessionHoverCard.ts`, the session grouping,
preferences, resizing, status and armed-delete helpers, and the original sidebar
styles. Files there are reference/replacement source, not all executed imports.

The used renderer source is `ai/frontend/src/pi/sidebar/` (also shipped in
`modified/sidebar/`):
- `sidebar-session-groups.ts`: original logic; type imports point to the Praat
  session projection, with an SPDX header added.
- `useSessionHoverCard.ts`: original hook and timings, redirected session type
  import and SPDX header. The adapted hook cancels pending dismissal before the
  same-target early return, so reentering a row keeps its preview visible.
- `use-armed-delete.ts`: original timed confirmation helper.
- `preview.ts`: upstream preview truncation and viewport placement logic,
  extracted from the original component.
- `upstream.css`: original sidebar-thread rules and sidebar-specific session
  rules, extracted with their selectors and tokens retained.
- `Sidebar.tsx`, `SessionHoverCard.tsx`, `types.ts`, and `styles.css`: adapted
  conversation-only renderer/controller and Praat data projection. Pi's compact
  rows, pin area, time groups, hover timings, modifier/range selection, menus,
  sorting and resizing are connected to the existing Praat ChatStore/RPC.
  Hover preview loads without selecting, and retains upstream pointer/focus
  handling. Name/date sorting persists via a validated host preference. Group
  labels are translated; historical time groups can collapse independently.
  Single deletion retains the existing confirmation dialog; multiple deletion
  uses Pi's timed arm, bound to the selected ID set, with readonly/running guards.
  Sidebar Ctrl/Cmd+B ignores editable controls. Existing sidebar resizing remains
  connected to the Praat host's width preference and keyboard controls.
- Usability adaptation: the native history scrollbar stays at the inside frame
  edge with a proportional thumb, but has a 14px pointer lane instead of Pi's
  6px lane. Its quiet thumb is 6px and grows to 10px on direct hover/press. The
  resize handle sits outside this lane. Pi's reveal/hold behavior is retained.
  The sidebar style sets the sidebar thumb's minimum height to
  68px (the measured 17px original native minimum plus three times that length).

The existing `SessionRow.tsx` consumes these LGPL renderer interactions and is
supplied in `rebuild/src/`: 120ms prefetch, preview hooks, compact rows, modifier
selection and the extracted context menu. The App/sidebar integration, host
validation and complete build inputs are likewise supplied in `rebuild/`.
No Pi Agent kernel, global Pi store, Electron IPC, project-management or
notification subsystem is bundled into the application runtime. Conversation archive operations are implemented by this project's own host.

## Codex history organization integration

`ContextMenu.tsx` additionally supports submenu/back markers and ArrowRight /
ArrowLeft navigation. `Sidebar.tsx` integrates local stable section headers,
per-section menus, nullable single membership, private conversation drag payloads,
ordered drop-before and archive actions linked to the settings archive manager. Existing Pi preview, modifiers,
focus navigation, sorting and resizing remain connected to the local host.
The scrollbar lane/minimum thumb settings above are unchanged.
`SessionRow.tsx` adds move/fork/archive actions; `HistoryOrganization.tsx` is a
project-local renderer for public Codex section semantics, not copied Codex
desktop React code. Source/Apache notices are separately in `codex-source/`.

## Search input integration

`upstream/search/` preserves original `SearchDialog.tsx`,
`features/app/useAppShellRuntime.tsx` and `styles/overlays.css`, verified against
the same fixed Git revision (`SOURCE.json` records blob/SHA-256 identities).
The search input's native composition guards (`isComposing` / keyCode 229),
plain text input and spelling/correction/capitalization attributes are reused
in `SearchBar.tsx` and the sidebar search. App/sidebar shortcuts use the same
upstream composition bypass. The upstream `outline: none` rule is applied to
the two search inputs with focus selectors strong enough to override this
project's global green focus outline. Keyboard focus on other controls remains.

Only the renderer input/event/style parts are connected to the current host;
Pi's app-store, command runner, project/search IPC and Agent runtime are not
imported. The existing Custom Highlight search implementation is retained.
All used local source is provided in `rebuild/src/`; this section records the
actual copied interaction fragments rather than claiming the full SearchDialog
and its separate search service execute here.

## Sidebar options / origin grouping

`upstream/sidebar-options/` additionally retains the unchanged
`apps/desktop/src/lib/project-name.ts`, with Git blob/SHA-256 provenance at the
same fixed revision. `modified/sidebar/project-name.ts` extracts its exact
`folderNameFromPath` function with an SPDX/source header; origin grouping also
reuses the previously copied `normalizeProjectPath` helper.
`Sidebar.tsx` delegates the toolbar to the Radix dropdown submenu component,
groups ordinary history by recorded project/connection or a single list, and
preserves the existing custom sections, pinned area, time grouping, previews,
selection, scroll and resizing. The original four sort choices are retained.
Menu source/host adapters ship in `rebuild/`; Radix retains its own MIT license.
No Pi project manager or remote execution runtime is imported.

Collapsed rail: `Sidebar.tsx` supplies a settings shortcut. Its gear delegates to the existing host settings
dashboard with the initial conversation/storage category. The existing model
settings entry retains the model category. No Pi navigation/runtime is added;
the current App/Settings source and unchanged expanded search are supplied in
`rebuild/`.

## Replace / rebuild

Production assets include this notice, both licenses, original excerpts, `modified/` (the exact used LGPL source), and `rebuild/` (frontend source/build inputs). The full project also includes `ai/frontend` and its pinned npm lockfile. You may modify/replace these LGPL renderer portions and reverse engineer the combined work for debugging those modifications; this distribution imposes no contrary restriction.

With Node/npm available, in `rebuild/` (or the full project's `ai/frontend`):
1. `npm ci`
2. `node scripts/offline-assets.mjs`
3. `npx tsc -b && npx vite build`
4. Replace the full project's `ai/frontend/dist` with the rebuilt `dist`, preserving these notices/licenses/source; close and reopen the frontend normally from Praat's menu.

The standalone rebuild recipe skips the full project's prebuild notice-copy step because notices/source are supplied beside `rebuild/`. The full project may use `npm run build` instead. No signature, proprietary loader or Pi IPC is required. The local deliverable is an unpacked source project, not a newly released installer. Any future installer must retain these notices and replacement/rebuild capability.
