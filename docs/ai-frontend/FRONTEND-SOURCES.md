# Modern frontend sources and adaptation boundaries

UI maintenance starts with applicable public Codex / PI-Desktop code and existing dependencies. Record copied files, extracted fragments and project-local interaction ports separately. Public protocol source does not establish access to unpublished desktop renderer source.

## Actual dependencies

Versions are pinned in [`ai/frontend/package.json`](../../ai/frontend/package.json) and its `package-lock.json` (resolved URLs and integrity hashes). Host dependencies are in [`ai/requirements.txt`](../../ai/requirements.txt).

The dependency notices generator preserves package-root LICENSE/NOTICE/COPYING texts and KaTeX font notices in `ai/frontend/public/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`, also shipped in `dist`. It includes installed non-development dependencies, not a precise tree-shaken bundle inventory. Packages lacking a root license text are explicitly identified with their source URLs; it does not claim to resolve all redistribution obligations automatically.

## Fixed source provenance

PI-Desktop baseline: [0d47d26769ecbeca1c3ab56fa83b58a91de8190e](https://github.com/vastsa/PI-Desktop/tree/0d47d26769ecbeca1c3ab56fa83b58a91de8190e), desktop package 0.16.0, LGPL-3.0. Exact originals and adaptation/rebuild boundaries are retained in [Pi NOTICE](../../ai/third_party/pi-desktop/NOTICE.md). ContextMenu, menu positioning, scrollbar reveal, sidebar grouping/hover/preview and relevant CSS are extracted or adapted under `src/pi/`. Search composition-key bypasses and input styling come from `SearchDialog.tsx`, `useAppShellRuntime.tsx` and `styles/overlays.css`; originals are under `upstream/search/`.

Window sizing, disclosure anchoring, transcript menu vocabulary, slash completion, mount windows, reading anchors and minimap use project-local implementations informed by Pi interaction references. ComposerStatus is project-local. Reading anchors and layout persistence use host RPC and SQLite/preferences; WebView2 private mode does not provide durable browser storage. No Pi application store, Electron IPC, plugin system, work panel or Agent runtime is bundled.

Codex baseline: [ab45264919aaeb8a421cc156f1a5459ef9d60b72](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/ab45264919aaeb8a421cc156f1a5459ef9d60b72), Apache-2.0. Exact originals, Git blob identities, SHA-256 and adaptations are retained in [Codex NOTICE](../../ai/third_party/codex/NOTICE.md). Thread section/appearance, sorting and archive/delete/source protocols are copied unchanged where identified in that notice. Host section membership, fork and archive aggregation adapt public semantics to the existing SQLite service. Renderer menus and archive pages use this project's assistant-ui/Pi/Radix components; public Codex source does not include these desktop React pages.

Search adapts Codex `tui/src/task_mentions.rs`, `rollout/src/search.rs`, `thread-store/src/local/search_threads.rs` and `thread-store/src/local/thread_history/search.rs` to React/Python/SQLite. The sidebar receives compact session IDs; the transcript uses a UTF-16 literal matcher and CSS highlights. See [search data flow](SEARCH-PERFORMANCE-RESULTS.zh-CN.md).

Production source distributions are generated under `dist/pi-desktop-source/` and `dist/codex-source/` with originals, modified files, license/notice materials and frontend rebuild inputs as defined by build scripts. Source checks should compare these outputs to their recorded fixed origins.

SillyTavern (AGPL-3.0) is an interaction reference for numeric sampling/token controls; its runtime and styles are not bundled.

## Model metadata

Four OpenAI model records and local budget handling use the fixed `@mariozechner/pi-ai` 0.73.1 publication. Exact publication hash, gitHead, MIT text provenance and endpoint restrictions are in [model sources](PI-MODEL-SOURCES.md). Python Pydantic AI/Graph and the local client remain the executors; same-named gateway models do not inherit official endpoint metadata.

Current module limits and implementation parameters are described in [interaction implementation](PI-DESKTOP-GAP-AUDIT.zh-CN.md); they do not establish additional product policy.
